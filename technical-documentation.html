<!--Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL.
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.-->

                <p>Before starting this module, you should have some familiarity with HTML and CSS. You are advised to work through the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS">Introduction to CSS</a> modules before starting on JavaScript.</p>
                <p>You should also have some familiarity with JavaScript basics before looking at JavaScript objects in detail. Before attempting this module, work through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps">JavaScript first steps</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks">JavaScript building blocks.</a></p>
                <p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa). You'll come across it quite often, so in this article we give you all you need to work with JSON using JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON.</p>

            <article>
                <p>JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas Crockford. Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, it can be used independently from JavaScript, and many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.</p>
                <p>JSON exists as a string — useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to access the data. This is not a big issue —  JavaScript provides a global JSON object that has methods available for converting between the two.</p>
                <p class="take-note">Note: Converting a string to a native object is called parsing, while converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network is called stringification.</p>
                <p>A JSON object can be stored in its own file, which is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json.</p>
                <h2>JSON Structure</h2>
                <p>As described above, a JSON is a string whose format very much resembles JavaScript object literal format. You can include the same basic data types inside JSON as you can in a standard JavaScript object — strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and other object literals. This allows you to construct a data hierarchy, like so:</p>
                <code>{<br/>
                    "squadName": "Super hero squad",<br/>
                    "homeTown": "Metro City",<br/>
                    "formed": 2016,<br/>
                    "secretBase": "Super tower",<br/>
                    "active": true,<br/>
                    "members": [<br/>
                    {<br/>
                    "name": "Molecule Man",<br/>
                    "age": 29,<br/>
                    "secretIdentity": "Dan Jukes",<br/>
                    "powers": [<br/>
                    "Radiation resistance",<br/>
                    "Turning tiny",<br/>
                    "Radiation blast"<br/>
                    ]<br/>
                    },<br/>
                    {<br/>
                    "name": "Madame Uppercut",<br/>
                    "age": 39,<br/>
                    "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",<br/>
                    "powers": [<br/>
                    "Million tonne punch",<br/>
                    "Damage resistance",<br/>
                    "Superhuman reflexes"<br/>
                    ]<br/>
                    },<br/>
                    {<br/>
                    "name": "Eternal Flame",<br/>
                    "age": 1000000,<br/>
                    "secretIdentity": "Unknown",<br/>
                    "powers": [<br/>
                    "Immortality",<br/>
                    "Heat Immunity",<br/>
                    "Inferno",<br/>
                    "Teleportation",<br/>
                    "Interdimensional travel"<br/>
                    ]<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    ]<br/>
                    }</code>
                <p> we loaded this object into a JavaScript program, parsed in a variable called superHeroes for example, we could then access the data inside it using the same dot/bracket notation we looked at in the JavaScript object basics article. For example:</p>
                <code>superHeroes.homeTown<br/>
                    superHeroes['active']</code>
                <p>To access data further down the hierarchy, you simply have to chain the required property names and array indexes together.  For example, to access the third superpower of the second hero listed in the members list, you'd do this:</p>
                <code>superHeroes['members'][1]['powers'][2]</code>
                <ol>
                    <li>First we have the variable name — superHeroes.</li>
                    <li>Inside that we want to access the members property, so we use ["members"].</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-code">members</span> contains an array populated by objects. We want to access the second object inside the array, so we use [1].</li>
                    <li>Inside this object, we want to access the powers property, so we use ["powers"].</li>
                    <li>Inside the powers property is an array containing the selected hero's superpowers. We want the third one, so we use [2].</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Arrays as JSON</h2>
                <p>Above we mentioned that JSON text basically looks like a JavaScript object, and this is mostly right. The reason we said "mostly right" is that an array is also valid JSON, for example:</p>
                <code>
                    [<br/>
                    {<br/>
                    "name": "Molecule Man",<br/>
                    "age": 29,<br/>
                    "secretIdentity": "Dan Jukes",<br/>
                    "powers": [<br/>
                    "Radiation resistance",<br/>
                    "Turning tiny",<br/>
                    "Radiation blast"<br/>
                    ]<br/>
                    },<br/>
                    {<br/>
                    "name": "Madame Uppercut",<br/>
                    "age": 39,<br/>
                    "secretIdentity": "Jane Wilson",<br/>
                    "powers": [<br/>
                    "Million tonne punch",<br/>
                    "Damage resistance",<br/>
                    "Superhuman reflexes"<br/>
                    ]<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    ]<br/>
